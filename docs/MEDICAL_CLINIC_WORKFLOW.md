# Medical Clinic Workflow - Patient-Centric Clinical Documentation

## Overview

Dr. Dieu Phan D.C's chiropractic management system implements a comprehensive medical clinic workflow that prioritizes patient information gathering before clinical documentation. This approach ensures thorough patient understanding and effective clinical care.

## Workflow Architecture

### 1. Patient-First Approach

The system follows a medical clinic standard where **patient information is gathered first**, then doctors can write clinical notes for each patient case:

```
Patient Registration → Medical History Collection → Clinical Assessment → Ongoing Documentation
```

### 2. Core Components

#### A. Patient Case Management (`/doctor/notes`)
- **Location**: `src/features/notes/components/Notes.jsx`
- **Purpose**: Primary interface for patient-centric clinical documentation
- **Features**:
  - Patient selection with comprehensive information display
  - Clinical notes creation with SOAP format support
  - Treatment history tracking
  - Medical information overview

#### B. Enhanced Patient Management (`src/features/patients/components/PatientCaseManagement.jsx`)
- **Comprehensive patient profiles** with:
  - Personal information and demographics
  - Medical history and chronic conditions
  - Current vitals and physical measurements
  - Insurance and emergency contact information
  - Treatment history with provider notes

### 3. Clinical Documentation System

#### SOAP Note Format Support
The system supports the standard medical documentation format:

- **S**ubjective: Chief complaint and patient's description
- **O**bjective: Physical examination findings and measurements
- **A**ssessment: Clinical diagnosis and evaluation
- **P**lan: Treatment plan and follow-up instructions

#### Note Types Available
1. **Initial Assessment** - First patient evaluation
2. **Progress Note** - Ongoing treatment documentation
3. **Follow-up** - Post-treatment evaluation
4. **Treatment Plan** - Comprehensive care planning
