# Persistent Authentication Implementation

## Overview
This implementation provides Facebook-like persistent authentication where users remain logged in across browser sessions and page refreshes, automatically redirecting to their dashboard when they return to the app.

## Key Features

### 1. **Automatic Session Restoration**
- When the app loads, it automatically checks for valid authentication data
- If valid tokens and user data exist, the user is automatically logged in
- No need to re-enter credentials on page refresh or browser restart

### 2. **Smart Redirects**
- Authenticated users are automatically redirected away from auth pages (login/register)
- Users visiting the root path (/) are redirected to their role-specific dashboard
- Maintains intended destination for protected routes

### 3. **Enhanced Loading Experience**
- Professional loading screens during session restoration
- Clear feedback about what's happening ("Restoring your session...")
- Consistent branding throughout the loading process

### 4. **Token Management**
- Automatic token refresh when needed
- Graceful handling of expired sessions
- Secure storage of authentication data

## How It Works

### Components

1. **AuthSessionManager** (`src/components/auth/AuthSessionManager.jsx`)
   - Wraps the entire app
   - Handles automatic redirects for authenticated users
   - Prevents access to auth pages when already logged in

2. **SessionLoadingScreen** (`src/components/loading/SessionLoadingScreen.jsx`)
   - Professional loading UI during session restoration
   - Consistent with app branding

3. **Enhanced useAuthReady Hook** (`src/hooks/useAuthReady.ts`)
   - Determines when authentication state is stable
   - Prevents race conditions during Redux persist rehydration
   - Provides comprehensive auth status information

4. **Session Utilities** (`src/utils/sessionUtils.js`)
   - Session validation and restoration logic
   - Path checking and redirect utilities
   - Invalid session cleanup

### Flow

1. **App Startup:**
   ```
   App loads → Redux Persist rehydrates → SessionLoadingScreen shows
   → Session validation → Auth state ready → Redirects if needed
   ```

2. **Already Authenticated User:**
   ```
   User visits /login → AuthSessionManager detects auth state
   → Redirects to /dashboard/[role]/[id]
   ```

3. **Page Refresh:**
   ```
   Page refreshes → Redux Persist restores state → Session validates
   → User remains on current page (if authorized) or redirects
   ```

## User Experience

### For Authenticated Users:
- ✅ Visiting login page → Automatically redirected to dashboard
- ✅ Page refresh → Stays logged in, no interruption
- ✅ Closing/reopening browser → Still logged in
- ✅ Direct dashboard URL → Works immediately if authenticated

### For Unauthenticated Users:
- ✅ Visiting protected routes → Redirected to login
- ✅ Login form → Works normally
- ✅ After login → Redirected to intended destination or dashboard

## Configuration

### Redux Persist Settings
```javascript
// In store/store.jsx
const authPersistConfig = {
  key: "auth",
  storage,
  whitelist: ["accessToken", "refreshToken", "userID", "role", "email", "username", "profile", "preferences"],
  version: 1,
};
```

### Auth Pages (where authenticated users are redirected from)
```javascript
// In components/auth/AuthSessionManager.jsx
const authPages = ['/login', '/register', '/forgot-password', '/reset-password'];
```

### Dashboard Path Generation
```javascript
// Pattern: /dashboard/[role]/[userID]
const dashboardPath = `/dashboard/${userRole.toLowerCase()}/${userID}`;
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Token Validation**: All stored tokens are validated before use
2. **Expiration Handling**: Expired tokens trigger automatic refresh
3. **Secure Storage**: Uses Redux Persist with localStorage (client-side encryption can be added)
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Invalid sessions are cleaned up automatically

## Testing the Implementation

### Scenario 1: Fresh Login
1. Visit `/login`
2. Enter credentials
3. Should redirect to dashboard
4. Refresh page → Should stay on dashboard

### Scenario 2: Direct Dashboard Access
1. Close browser
2. Reopen and visit `/dashboard/patient/123`
3. Should load directly (if previously authenticated)
4. Or redirect to login (if not authenticated)

### Scenario 3: Auth Page Access When Logged In
1. While logged in, visit `/login`
2. Should immediately redirect to dashboard
3. Shows "Welcome back!" message briefly

### Scenario 4: Logout and Cleanup
1. Click logout
2. Try visiting dashboard URL
3. Should redirect to login

## Customization

### Changing Redirect Behavior
Modify `AuthSessionManager.jsx` to change where authenticated users are redirected:

```javascript
// Custom redirect logic
if (isAuthenticated && userID && userRole) {
  // Custom logic here
  const customPath = getCustomDashboardPath(userRole, userID);
  navigate(customPath, { replace: true });
}
```

### Loading Screen Customization
Modify `SessionLoadingScreen.jsx` to match your brand:

```javascript
// Custom branding
<div style={{ color: '#YOUR_BRAND_COLOR' }}>
  Your App Name
</div>
```

## Benefits

1. **User Experience**: Seamless experience similar to major platforms
2. **Reduced Friction**: Users don't need to re-login frequently
3. **Professional Feel**: Polished loading states and transitions
4. **Security**: Proper token management and validation
5. **Reliability**: Handles edge cases and error states gracefully

This implementation ensures your users have a smooth, Facebook-like authentication experience where they stay logged in across sessions and are automatically directed to the right place in your application.
